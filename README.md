# Customer Segment Pro

An interactive Streamlit application that predicts customer segments based on purchasing and engagement behavior. The project combines an offline notebook workflow (`customer_pro.ipynb`) for data exploration and clustering model training with an online experience (`segmentation.py`) where business users can input customer attributes and instantly obtain a segment prediction generated by a persisted Scikit-learn KMeans model and scaler.

## Dataset & Models
- **Dataset:** `customer_segmentation.csv` – marketing and transactional features such as age, income, spending totals, channel interactions, and recency.
- **Artifacts:** `kmeans_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` produced in the notebook and loaded by the Streamlit app for inference.

## App Features
- Clean two-column UI for entering customer characteristics.
- Instant prediction of cluster assignment with friendly descriptions.
- Pre-populated defaults to explore segments without any CSV uploads.

## Getting Started
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the Streamlit interface:
   ```bash
   streamlit run segmentation.py
   ```
4. Adjust inputs and click **Predict Segment** to view the assigned cluster along with curated descriptions.

## Project Structure
- `customer_pro.ipynb` – exploration, feature engineering, and model training.
- `segmentation.py` – Streamlit UI and inference logic (loads scaler + KMeans).
- `kmeans_model.pkl` / `scaler.pkl` – persisted sklearn artifacts.
- `customer_segmentation.csv` – source dataset for experimentation.

## Extending the Project
- Add authentication to expose the app internally.
- Enrich segment descriptions with metrics, charts, or recommended actions.
- Automate training to refresh `kmeans_model.pkl` on new data.
- Containerize the Streamlit app for repeatable deployment.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure `kmeans_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` are in the project root before running the app.
- If Streamlit cannot find the models, retrain/export them from the notebook or update the paths in `segmentation.py`.
